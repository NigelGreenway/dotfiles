# Dotfiles

My local configuration files for bash, vim, tmux and whatever else that I **need**.

_The initial idea is to have all of my dotfiles set up and then extract each section into it's own repo to allow for the use of some kind of bash package manager._

**please be aware that this runs by running `sudo`. Always read the code before running.**

To install, simply run the following:

```shell
curl http://git.fpixels.net/NigelGreenway/dotfiles/raw/master/initial-install | sudo bash
```

You are able to customise this - although limited - by editing the `package` files in the related subdirectories.
